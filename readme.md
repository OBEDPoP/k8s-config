## Types of Kubernetes Installations
Kubernetes can be installed using various methods based on the use case, infrastructure, and level of control required.

### 1. **Managed Kubernetes Services**
Managed Kubernetes services are provided by cloud vendors who handle the control plane, upgrades, and high availability.
   
   - **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**
   - **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
   - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
   - **DigitalOcean Kubernetes**
   - **IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service**

   **Advantages:**
   - No need to manage control plane components.
   - Automatic updates, patches, and backups.
   - Integrated with cloud IAM and security policies.
   - Seamless scalability and high availability.
   
   **Use Case:** Ideal for enterprises looking for a managed, scalable, and hassle-free Kubernetes environment.

### 2. **Self-Hosted Kubernetes**
Self-hosted Kubernetes gives full control over cluster configuration but requires manual management.
   
   - **kubeadm**: Best for on-prem and production clusters.
   - **kops**: Used for managing Kubernetes on AWS.
   - **Kuberspray**: Uses Ansible for Kubernetes deployment.

   **Advantages:**
   - Full control over the cluster setup.
   - No vendor lock-in.
   - Customizable networking, security, and performance tuning.
   
   **Use Case:** Suitable for enterprises with strict compliance, security, or hybrid cloud/on-premise requirements.

### 3. **Local Kubernetes Installations**
Local Kubernetes installations are lightweight and useful for development and testing.

   - **Minikube**: Runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on a local machine.
   - **kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**: Deploys Kubernetes inside Docker containers.
   - **MicroK8s**: Lightweight Kubernetes optimized for edge computing and IoT.

   **Advantages:**
   - Easy and quick to set up.
   - Lightweight and low resource consumption.
   - Ideal for local testing and CI/CD pipelines.
   
   **Use Case:** Best for developers and testers working on Kubernetes applications in a local environment.

### 4. **Enterprise Kubernetes Solutions**
Enterprise solutions provide additional security, governance, and monitoring features.

   - **Red Hat OpenShift**: Enterprise Kubernetes with integrated DevOps tools.
   - **VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (TKG)**: Kubernetes for VMware environments.
   - **Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)**: Rancher's Kubernetes distribution.

   **Advantages:**
   - Enhanced security and compliance.
   - Multi-cluster and hybrid cloud support.
   - Built-in monitoring and analytics.
   
   **Use Case:** Best for large enterprises needing strict security, governance, and multi-cluster management.

## Kubernetes Commands
Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) is the primary tool for managing Kubernetes clusters.

### Cluster Management:
```sh
kubectl cluster-info           # View cluster details
kubectl get nodes              # List cluster nodes
kubectl get pods -A            # List all pods in all namespaces
kubectl delete node <node>     # Remove a node from the cluster
```

### Deployments & Services:
```sh
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx   # Create a deployment
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=LoadBalancer --port=80  # Expose a deployment
kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=3    # Scale up/down a deployment
kubectl delete deployment nginx                # Delete a deployment
```

### Pods & Logs:
```sh
kubectl get pods                # List running pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>  # Get detailed pod info
kubectl logs <pod-name>          # View pod logs
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh  # Access pod shell
```

### ConfigMaps & Secrets:
```sh
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=env=production
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=password=my-pass
```

### Troubleshooting:
```sh
kubectl get events               # View cluster events
kubectl get pods --field-selector=status.phase=Pending  # Check stuck pods
kubectl logs -f <pod-name>       # Stream pod logs
kubectl describe node <node-name>  # Get node details
```

## Kubernetes Crash Course (Real-World Use Case: E-Commerce Platform)
This crash course will guide you through setting up and managing an e-commerce platform on Kubernetes. 

### 1. **Deploying Microservices:**
- Create deployments for `frontend`, `product-service`, `order-service`, and `user-service`.
- Use ConfigMaps for environment variables.
- Implement health checks with `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`.

### 2. **Scaling for High Traffic:**
- Use `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler` (HPA) for auto-scaling pods.
- Implement `Cluster Autoscaler` to add/remove worker nodes.
- Distribute traffic using `Ingress Controller`.

### 3. **Ensuring High Availability:**
- Deploy databases using StatefulSets (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
- Configure persistent storage with `Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)`.
- Implement PodDisruptionBudgets for availability.

### 4. **Security Best Practices:**
- Restrict access using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
- Use Network Policies to limit communication between services.
- Scan images for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

### 5. **Logging & Monitoring:**
- Install Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- Use Fluentd to collect logs and store them in Elasticsearch.
- Implement alerting for pod failures and high resource usage.

### 6. **Continuous Deployment & CI/CD:**
- Use Helm charts to package applications.
- Implement ArgoCD or FluxCD for GitOps deployment.
- Automate deployment pipelines with Jenkins/GitHub Actions.

## Helm Package Management
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps manage applications using Helm Charts.

### Helm Commands:
```sh
helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable   # Add Helm repository
helm search repo nginx                               # Search for a chart
helm install my-release stable/nginx                # Install a chart
helm list                                           # List installed releases
helm upgrade my-release stable/nginx                # Upgrade an existing release
helm rollback my-release 1                          # Rollback to a previous version
helm uninstall my-release                           # Uninstall a release
```

Helm simplifies application deployments by providing reusable, configurable templates.
